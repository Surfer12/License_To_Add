## ✨ Purpose

This framework is part of an interdisciplinary vision to combine **symbolic rigor**, **neural adaptability**, and **cognitive-aligned reasoning**. It reflects years of integrated work at the intersection of computer science, biopsychology, and meta-epistemology.

It is not just software. It is a **cognitive architecture**, and its use is **ethically bounded**.

## 🔐 Licensing Model

This repository is licensed under a **hybrid model** to balance openness, reciprocity, and authorship protection.

### 1. For Commons-Aligned Users (students, researchers, cooperatives)
Use it under the **Peer Production License (PPL)**. You can:
- Study, adapt, and share it freely
- Use it in academic or nonprofit research
- Collaborate openly within the digital commons

### 2. For Public Use and Transparency
The AGPLv3 license guarantees:
- Network-based deployments must share modifications
- Derivatives must remain open source
- Attribution is mandatory

### 3. For Commercial or Extractive Use
You **must not use this work** if you are a:
- For-profit AI company
- Venture-backed foundation
- Closed-source platform
...unless you **negotiate a commercial license** directly.
