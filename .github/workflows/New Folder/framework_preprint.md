## Abstract

This preprint introduces a meta-optimization-based framework that integrates symbolic logic engines and neural networks with cognitive-aligned regularization. The system models attentional allocation, cognitive efficiency penalties, and bias alignment to enable interpretable and performant hybrid theorem proving.
