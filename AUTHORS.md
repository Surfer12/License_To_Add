### Declaration

I, Ryan Oates, hereby declare that I am the sole original author of the Meta-Optimized Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Framework and all associated theoretical formulations.

**Original Work Includes**:
- All theoretical formulations, including Ψ(x), α(t), and Rcognitive
- Core cognitive architecture design
- Swift implementation framework
- Integration of symbolic logic and neural network components
- Meta-optimization algorithms and cognitive regularization methods

**Licensing Terms**:
- The framework is published under dual license: AGPLv3 and Peer Production License (PPL)
- Commercial or extractive usage must be negotiated separately
- Attribution is mandatory for all derivative works
- Community contributions are welcomed under the CCA

**Academic Foundation**:
This work originates from interdisciplinary research at the intersection of computer science, biopsychology, and meta-epistemology, with theoretical roots in flow state modeling and Jungian epistemological structures.
