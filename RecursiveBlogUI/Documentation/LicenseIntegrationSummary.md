- Contributor recognition system
- Academic citation guidelines

### 4. File-Specific Guidelines
- Swift source file headers
- Documentation file licensing
- Asset file attribution
- Consistent application patterns

## Cross-References and Links

### Internal References

## Legacy Files

The original license files in the `licenses/` directory can now be considered legacy:
- `licenses/LICENSE_AGPL.txt` - Superseded by LICENSE.md
- `licenses/LICENSE_PPL.txt` - Integrated into LICENSE.md
- `licenses/community_contributor_agreement.md` - Integrated into CONTRIBUTING.md

These files can be archived or removed after confirming no external references exist.

## Conclusion

The licensing documentation has been successfully integrated into the RecursiveBlogUI project structure, creating a comprehensive, self-contained system that supports both open-source collaboration and ethical commercial use. The integration maintains professional standards while reflecting the project's commitment to cognitive-computational sovereignty and ethical technology development.
