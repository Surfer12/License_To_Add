A cognitive architecture that combines symbolic rigor, neural adaptability, and cognitive-aligned reasoning. This is not just software but a cognitive architecture with ethical boundaries.

**Author**: Ryan Oates (ryan_oates@my.cuesta.edu)  
**Academic Context**: Interdisciplinary work at intersection of computer science, biopsychology, and meta-epistemology

## Core Purpose
- Hybrid theorem proving with cognitive constraints
- Meta-optimization in reasoning systems
- Integration of symbolic logic and neural networks
- Flow state modeling and Jungian epistemological structures

## Licensing Philosophy
**Dual License Model**: AGPLv3 + Peer Production License (PPL)
- Commons-aligned users (students, researchers, cooperatives): Use under PPL
- Public/transparent use: AGPLv3 ensures network deployments share modifications
- Commercial/extractive use: Requires separate commercial license negotiation

## Ethical Boundaries
- No integration into closed-source LLM deployments
- No reselling without explicit approval
