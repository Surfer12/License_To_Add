# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The theorem proving interface provides a user-facing API for automated theorem proving within the Meta-Optimized Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Framework. This interface will allow users to submit mathematical theorems, logical statements, and proofs for automated verification and generation, leveraging the framework's hybrid neuro-symbolic reasoning capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mathematician or researcher, I want to submit theorem statements through a programmatic API, so that I can integrate automated theorem proving into my research workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a theorem statement THEN the system SHALL accept LaTeX mathematical notation with Markdown preview compatibility
2. WHEN a theorem is submitted THEN the system SHALL return a unique proof session identifier
3. IF the theorem statement is malformed THEN the system SHALL return a descriptive error message with LaTeX syntax guidance
4. WHEN a theorem is accepted THEN the system SHALL validate the logical structure before processing
5. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL render LaTeX expressions in Markdown-compatible format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure proof search parameters, so that I can optimize the proving process for different types of problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a proof session THEN the system SHALL accept timeout parameters for proof search duration
2. WHEN configuring a proof session THEN the system SHALL accept depth limits for proof tree exploration
3. WHEN configuring a proof session THEN the system SHALL accept strategy preferences (neural-heavy, symbolic-heavy, or balanced)
4. IF invalid configuration parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL return validation errors with acceptable ranges

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive structured proof results, so that I can understand and verify the automated reasoning process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a proof is completed THEN the system SHALL return the proof status (proven, disproven, or timeout)
2. WHEN a theorem is proven THEN the system SHALL provide a step-by-step proof trace
3. WHEN a theorem is disproven THEN the system SHALL provide a counterexample
4. WHEN a proof times out THEN the system SHALL return partial progress and intermediate results
5. WHEN returning results THEN the system SHALL include confidence scores from the neuro-symbolic reasoning

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to query proof session status and retrieve results asynchronously, so that I can handle long-running proof attempts efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying a proof session THEN the system SHALL return current status (running, completed, failed, or cancelled)
2. WHEN a proof is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and estimated completion time
3. WHEN requesting to cancel a proof THEN the system SHALL terminate the session and return partial results
4. WHEN retrieving completed results THEN the system SHALL return the full proof data structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an educator, I want to submit proof verification requests, so that I can check student-generated proofs for correctness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting a proof for verification THEN the system SHALL accept both the theorem statement and proposed proof steps
2. WHEN verifying a proof THEN the system SHALL validate each logical step for correctness
3. WHEN a proof step is invalid THEN the system SHALL identify the specific error and suggest corrections
4. WHEN a proof is valid THEN the system SHALL confirm correctness and highlight key reasoning patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can diagnose issues and monitor system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API operation fails THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with error codes
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL log all operations with appropriate detail levels
3. WHEN system resources are exhausted THEN the system SHALL return resource limitation errors
4. WHEN the neuro-symbolic engine encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information about the reasoning failure
