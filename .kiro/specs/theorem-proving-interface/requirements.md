# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The theorem proving interface provides a user-facing API for automated theorem proving within the Meta-Optimized Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Framework. This interface will allow users to submit mathematical theorems, logical statements, and proofs for automated verification and generation, leveraging the framework's hybrid neuro-symbolic reasoning capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mathematician or researcher, I want to submit theorem statements through a programmatic API, so that I can integrate automated theorem proving into my research workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a theorem statement THEN the system SHALL accept LaTeX mathematical notation with Markdown preview compatibility
2. WHEN a theorem is submitted THEN the system SHALL return a unique proof session identifier
3. IF the theorem statement is malformed THEN the system SHALL return a descriptive error message with LaTeX syntax guidance
4. WHEN a theorem is accepted THEN the system SHALL validate the logical structure before processing
5. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL render LaTeX expressions in Markdown-compatible format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure proof search parameters, so that I can optimize the proving process for different types of problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a proof session THEN the system SHALL accept timeout parameters for proof search duration
2. WHEN configuring a proof session THEN the system SHALL accept depth limits for proof tree exploration
3. WHEN configuring a proof session THEN the system SHALL accept strategy preferences (neural-heavy, symbolic-heavy, or balanced)
4. IF invalid configuration parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL return validation errors with acceptable ranges

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive structured proof results, so that I can understand and verify the automated reasoning process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a proof is completed THEN the system SHALL return the proof status (proven, disproven, or timeout)
2. WHEN a theorem is proven THEN the system SHALL provide a step-by-step proof trace
3. WHEN a theorem is disproven THEN the system SHALL provide a counterexample
4. WHEN a proof times out THEN the system SHALL return partial progress and intermediate results
5. WHEN returning results THEN the system SHALL include confidence scores from the neuro-symbolic reasoning

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to query proof session status and retrieve results asynchronously, so that I can handle long-running proof attempts efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying a proof session THEN the system SHALL return current status (running, completed, failed, or cancelled)
2. WHEN a proof is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and estimated completion time
3. WHEN requesting to cancel a proof THEN the system SHALL terminate the session and return partial results
4. WHEN retrieving completed results THEN the system SHALL return the full proof data structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an educator, I want to submit proof verification requests, so that I can check student-generated proofs for correctness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting a proof for verification THEN the system SHALL accept both the theorem statement and proposed proof steps
2. WHEN verifying a proof THEN the system SHALL validate each logical step for correctness
3. WHEN a proof step is invalid THEN the system SHALL identify the specific error and suggest corrections
4. WHEN a proof is valid THEN the system SHALL confirm correctness and highlight key reasoning patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher with multiple theorems, I want to submit batch processing requests, so that I can efficiently process large sets of mathematical problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting a batch request THEN the system SHALL accept multiple theorem statements in a single API call
2. WHEN processing batches THEN the system SHALL utilize Claude API for parallel theorem analysis and reasoning
3. WHEN a batch is submitted THEN the system SHALL return a batch identifier and individual session IDs for each theorem
4. WHEN querying batch status THEN the system SHALL provide progress for individual theorems and overall completion percentage
5. WHEN batch processing completes THEN the system SHALL return results for all theorems with individual success/failure status

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want secure authentication, so that my theorem proving sessions are protected and authorized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the API THEN the system SHALL require authentication via Cloudflare Warp tunnel
2. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL support FIDO2/WebAuthn with YubiKey hardware tokens
3. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL establish a secure session with appropriate token expiration
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error codes and rate limit failed attempts
5. WHEN session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication before allowing further API access

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can diagnose issues and monitor system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API operation fails THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with error codes
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL log all operations with appropriate detail levels
3. WHEN system resources are exhausted THEN the system SHALL return resource limitation errors
4. WHEN the neuro-symbolic engine encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information about the reasoning failure

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want performance guarantees and monitoring, so that I can ensure reliable service delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing simple theorems THEN the system SHALL respond within 5 seconds for 95% of requests
2. WHEN handling concurrent sessions THEN the system SHALL support at least 100 simultaneous proof sessions
3. WHEN LaTeX expressions exceed 10KB THEN the system SHALL return size limit errors with guidance
4. WHEN network interruptions occur during long proofs THEN the system SHALL resume from last checkpoint
5. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL provide real-time metrics for CPU, memory, and queue depth

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user concerned about privacy, I want data protection and retention controls, so that my mathematical work remains secure and private.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL remove all personal proof history within 30 days
2. WHEN storing proof sessions THEN the system SHALL encrypt all data at rest and in transit
3. WHEN proof sessions expire THEN the system SHALL automatically purge session data after 90 days
4. WHEN users access their data THEN the system SHALL provide export functionality in standard formats
5. WHEN processing personal data THEN the system SHALL comply with GDPR and similar privacy regulations

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want inclusive interface design, so that I can effectively use the theorem proving system regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying LaTeX expressions THEN the system SHALL provide alternative text descriptions for screen readers
2. WHEN rendering mathematical notation THEN the system SHALL support high contrast and scalable font options
